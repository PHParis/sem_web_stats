HDT-Fuseki

This module sets up a Fuseki SPARQL Endpoint backed up by one or many HDT files.

# Compiling

mvn package dependency:copy-dependencies

# Using

$ bin/hdtEndpoint.sh --hdt path/to/dataset.hdt /dataset

Open your Web Browser and go to:
http://localhost:3030

Select Control Panel / Dataset / myDataset and click Select

Type your SPARQL Query and see the results.

If you want to give access to this endpoint to any application, you can use the following uri:

http://yourhostname:3030/dataset/


# Configuring

hdtEndpoint is a fork of Fuseki's fuseki-server. Therefore you can use any of Fuseki's configuration options, such as --port or --gzip

# Loading more than one HDT file

Passing more than one HDT in the command line is not supported. In this case you need to create a Jena assembly specification that defines how to create the dataset. A dataset is defined as a default graph, and zero to many named graphs. A fully-commented example is available at fuseki_example.ttl. As mentioned before, this is a general Fuseki config file, so you can use any of the options of Jena assemblies, for example you can load a few HDT files together with some TDB datasets in the same server.

In this case, we need to launch the server using:

$ bin/hdtEndpoint --config=fuseki_example.ttl
